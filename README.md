# VtuberNoisesAutomation
Vtuber Noises Automation is a C++ program that was developed to help me code at a faster rate to develop more Vtuber Noises based projects. Previously, I was doing everthing on my own manually. Writing every single line of code and editing the audio and images. This meant long hours of work and typos that often lead to errors in the code.<br>
Ever since it was developed, it has been able to help me all of the code for Vtuber Noises based app. This allows me to have more time to edit audio and images and fine tune the UI and spend more time on my other projects.<br>
Now I want you to use it, study it ,modify it and most importantly enjoy it.
